# Java Swing Projects Repository

Welcome to my Java Swing projects repository! Here you will find a collection of Java applications built using the Swing library for graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Each project is designed to provide practical examples and demonstrations of various aspects of GUI programming in Java.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different folders, each corresponding to a specific class or topic. Here's a brief description of each folder:

1. **Class 2**
   - Projects related to the topics covered in Class 2.

2. **Class 3**
   - Projects developed based on the concepts presented in Class 3.

3. **Class 4**
   - Contains projects that expand upon the knowledge acquired in Class 4.

4. **Class 5**
   - Projects that extend the techniques learned during Class 5.

5. **Student Interviews**
   - Contains resources related to interviews with students about Java Swing projects.

6. **Students**
   - Additional resources and Java Swing projects related to students.

7. **Average**
   - Projects related to the calculation and management of averages, likely developed based on specific exercises or concepts.

## How to Use this Repository

Each folder contains standalone projects with their own set of source files and resources required for operation. To explore a particular project:

1. Navigate to the folder containing the project you're interested in.
2. Review the source code and associated files to understand the functionality and implementation of the project.
3. Use a Java development environment to compile and run the project.
4. Experiment with the application and become familiar with the Java Swing features applied in the project.
